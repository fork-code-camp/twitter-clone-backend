## Main Services

* [Authentication service](#authentication-service)
* [Storage service](#storage-service)
* [Profile service](#profile-service)
* [Tweet service](#tweet-service)
* [Timeline service](#timeline-service)

### Authentication service

Handles user registration, authorization, and generation of JWT tokens for secure login that expires after 24 hours.
Once the user activates their account by entering the code, they can log in using their email and password and receive a
personal JWT token that expires after 24 hours.

### Storage service

Connects to Amazon blob storage, enabling users to store and retrieve media files.

### Profile service

Allows users to view and follow other users, update their profiles, and upload custom avatars and banners. The service
utilizes caching to store popular user profiles for improved performance.

### Tweet service

Provides users to create/update/delete tweets, as well as retweet/like/reply on them. Also, there is views
system, so when user get any tweet, views counter is incremented by 1, and cache system that will cache popular tweets.
When user creates new tweet, it will be added to user's user timeline and home timelines of his followers in cache, but
if user has a lot of followers, it will be added only to user timeline.

### Timeline service

Provides any type of timeline for user. When user gets his user timeline, then it will
be received from cache, but if it's absent there, it will be requested from tweet service which will obtain it from
database and give it back sorted by chronological order. When user gets his home timeline, service tries to obtain it
from cache, but if there was nothing, then it will take user timeline of every followee of that user, sort resulted list
and cache it for further usage. As is known celebrities don't push created tweets to home timelines of followers, so
that service take user timeline of every followee celebrity and add those tweets to the response as well as sort it by
chronological order.

## Auxiliary services

* [Api Gateway](#api-gateway)
* [Discovery server](#discovery-server-and-loadbalancer)
* [Cloud config server](#cloud-config-server)

### Api Gateway

Acts as a centralized access point for the application, ensuring secure interaction with the services using JWT tokens.

### Discovery server and LoadBalancer

Facilitates microservice communication by enabling service discovery and load balancing.

### Cloud config server

Provides configuration properties for all services in the application.
